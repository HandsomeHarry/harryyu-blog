# Stupid Encryption

Sometimes the simplest solutions are the most entertaining. Here's a look at a deliberately "stupid" encryption method I created for educational purposes.

The basic idea was to create an encryption that looks complex but is actually quite simple to break. It serves as a good example of why proper cryptography is important.

While this was just a fun project, it highlights the importance of using proven encryption methods rather than rolling your own. Security through obscurity rarely works!
